RED TARGET


IDOR vulnerability with incrementing the url id

To do this which was very simple and covered early in the class was to go to the find a salesperson page and then the id corresponds to a user and just increment that id over the shown user count. In this example I put in 11 and it sent me to a page that I could not normally get to which shows an employee that was fired for being lazy.

This is a very simple and common vulnerability to recreate!!
